# Libraries

Our Minecraft libraries provide reusable components, utilities, and core logic so plugins can share a consistent look and behavior.

They include:

- UI components and shared styling
- Common APIs and helper utilities
- Data models and serialization tools
- Versioning and compatibility guidance

Use these libraries to reduce duplication and ensure a consistent user experience across plugins. See the individual package pages for installation instructions, API references, and examples.
